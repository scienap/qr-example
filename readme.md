## Project Overview

This repository serves as a storage point for test content used by our internal application. It's important to take note that all the data contained within this repository are solely for testing purposes. The content in this repository is accessed via a QR code, which directly points to the raw file within GitHub.

## Generating a QR code pointing to the raw data
Are you interested in generating a QR Code that points directly to the raw data? Follow these steps:

1. Locate the file you want to point to within the repository.
2. Click on the file to open it.
3. Click on the `Raw` button on the right side just above the file content. This will take you to a window that displays just the raw data in plaintext.
4. Copy the URL from your browser URL bar.
5. Access a QR Code generator - these are widely available online. One example is qr-code-generator.com.
6. Paste the copied URL into the generator and generate your QR Code.

Now you can easily point to this data via the QR Code, allowing for easy and direct access.
